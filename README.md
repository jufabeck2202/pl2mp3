## Setup:
### Setup Download folder:
* In order to use **pl2mp3** you first have to create a download Directory. This Directory will be used by pl2mp3 to download and convert new videos. Run following command to create a new download Directory

```shell
pl2mp3 --init <Directory name>
```
* This will create a new directory with a *db.json* file and a *config.json* file.
### Setup config.json:
* After runing the --init command, **pl2mp3** created a *config.json* file. The *config.json* file is used to specify the playlists you want to download and other options.
* When adding new playlists to the config.json, make sure that the Youtube playlists are **public**.
#### Sample config:
* Following config will download and watch two Playlists.
```json
{
  "playlists": [
      {
          "link": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfpHPxe91z9NEwLMsxfmAehlZnoTzRFB8"
      },
      {
          "link": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfpHPxe91z9OsVABLuXljh78LwiP8ToXq"
      }
  ]
}
```
#### Split option:
* You can add the following option to split mp3s into smaller clips
```json
{
  "playlists": [
      {
          "link": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfpHPxe91z9NEwLMsxfmAehlZnoTzRFB8",
          "split":true,
          "split-duration":"03:00"
      }
  ]
}
```
*This will split every mp3 file into 3 min clips, with proper names.

### Start pl2mp3
* After creating a Download Directory and customizing the config.json you can start **pl2mp3**. Run following command to start watching:
```shell
pl2mp3 <Directory name>
```
* **pl2mp3** will create a seperate folder for each playlist and will start downloading and converting all videos inside the playlists. 
* After that **pl2mp3** will look every 10 min for newly added videos to download them too. You can change the time by using the `--update <min>` flag.
